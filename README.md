# Run the project
You have to follow the steps below to run this project locally.<br>
  
## Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)  (Build a backend server that can communicate with the Arduino board)
* Install [SerialPort](https://serialport.io/docs/en/guide-about) (Node.js package to access serial ports)
* Install [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) ( A JavaScript Robotics & IoT Platform)
* Install [Node-Pixel](https://github.com/ajfisher/node-pixel) (A library that provides a node js interface for addressable RGB LEDs)
* Install [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (A library that allow us to build a fake online REST server )<br>
## Installation
#### NodeJS
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
#### SerialPort
```
Node.js package to access serial ports
```
Notice: Compiling with nodejs is done via node-gyp which requires Python 2.x, so please ensure you have it installed and in your path for all operating systems. Python 3.x will not work. You can try [prebuild](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild) to compile and post binaries of the library for most common use cases (Linux, Mac, Windows on standard processor platforms).
#### Johnny-five
```
npm install johnny-five
```
#### Node-pixel
```
npm install node-pixel
npm install -g nodebots-interchange
```
Plug in your arduino
```
interchange install git+https://github.com/ajfisher/node-pixel -a uno --firmata
```
#### Json-server
```
npm install -g json-server
```
## Begin to run
#### Start JSON server
```
json-server --watch fragranceDB.json --port 3002
```
#### Connect your Arduino
#### Start the web server
```
node index.js
```
# Now you will be ready to run this project! Have fun ðŸ˜†
